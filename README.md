## Summary  |  Pewlett Hackard - Employee DB

Pewlett Hackard has provided various csv files of an old employee database and is requsting information from these records. Using <a href="https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/">QuickDBD</a> I mapped out a SQL database and imported the csv files. Once the database was completed, I was able to query the information needed.
